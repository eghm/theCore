        <p class="lead">Use Protocol Check when you believe a protocol is being used incorrectly in any way or when a Core Commitment is being broken.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Say “Protocol Check.”</li>
          <li>If you know the correct use of the protocol, state it. If you don’t, ask for help.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Commitments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Say “Protocol Check” as soon as you become aware of the incorrect use of a protocol, or of a broken Core Commitment. Do this regardless of the current activity.</li>
          <li>Be supportive of anyone using Protocol Check.</li>
          <li>Do not shame or punish anyone using Protocol Check.</li>
          <li>Ask for help as soon as you realize you are unsure of the correct protocol use.</li>
        </ul>
