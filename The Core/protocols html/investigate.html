        <p class="lead">Investigate allows you to learn about a phenomenon that occurs in someone else. Use it when an idea or behavior someone is presenting seems poor, confusing, or simply interesting.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Act as if you were a detached but fascinated inquirer, asking questions until your curiosity is satisfied or you no longer want to ask questions.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Commitments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask well-formed questions.</li>
          <li>Ask only questions that will increase your understanding.</li>
          <li>Ask questions only if the subject is engaged and appears ready to answer more.</li>
          <li>Refrain from offering opinions.</li>
          <li>Do not ask leading questions where you think you know how he or she will answer.</li>
          <li>If you cannot remain a detached, curious investigator with no agenda, stop using the protocol until you can come back to it and keep these commitments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not theorize about the subject or provide any sort of diagnosis.</li>
          <li>Consider using the following forms for your questions:
            <ul>
              <li>What about X makes you Y Z?</li>
              <li>Would you explain a specific example?</li>
              <li>How does X go when it happens?</li>
              <li>What is the one thing you want most from solving X?</li>
              <li>What is the biggest problem you see regarding X now?</li>
              <li>What is the most important thing you could do right now to help you with X?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Ineffective queries include the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Questions that lead or reflect an agenda.</li>
              <li>Questions that attempt to hide an answer you believe is true.</li>
              <li>Questions that invite stories.</li>
              <li>Questions that begin with “Why.”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Stick to your intention of gathering more information.</li>
          <li>If you feel that you will explode if you can’t say what’s on your mind, you shouldn’t speak at all. Consider checking your intention or <a href="/core-protocols/check-out/">Check Out</a>.</li>
        </ul>
