        <p class="lead">Use Intention Check to clarify the purpose of your own or another’s behavior. Use it when you aren’t expecting a positive outcome resulting from the current behavior. Intention Check assesses the integrity of your own and another’s intention in a given case.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Ask “What is your/my intention with X?” where X equals some type of actual or pending behavior to the person whose intention you want to know.</li>
          <li>If it would be helpful, ask “What response or behavior did you want from whom as X?”</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Commitments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be aware of your own intention before checking the intention of another.</li>
          <li>Investigate sufficiently to uncover the intention of the person or his actions.</li>
          <li>Make sure you have the intention to resolve any possible conflict peacefully before intention checking someone else. If you do not have a peaceful intention, Check Out.</li>
          <li>Do not be defensive when someone asks you what your intention is. If you can’t do this, Check Out.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If conflict arises that seems irresolvable, Check Out and Ask For Help.</li>
        </ul>
