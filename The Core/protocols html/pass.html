        <p class="lead">The Pass protocol is how you decline to participate in something. Use it anytime you don’t want to participate in an activity.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>When you’ve decided not to participate, say “I pass.”</li>
          <li>Unpass any time you desire. Unpass as soon as you know you want to participate again by saying “I unpass.”</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Commitments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hold reasons for passing private.</li>
          <li>Pass on something as soon as you are aware you are going to pass.</li>
          <li>Respect the right of others to pass without explanation.</li>
          <li>Support those who pass by not discussing them or their pass.</li>
          <li>Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate or punish anyone who passes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In general, you will not be in good standing with your Core Commitments if you pass most of the time.</li>
          <li>You can pass on any activity; however, if you have adopted the Core Commitments, you cannot pass on a&nbsp;<a href="/core-protocols/pass-unpass/">Decider</a>&nbsp;vote and you must say “I’m in” when checking in.</li>
          <li>You can pass even though you have already started something.</li>
        </ul>
